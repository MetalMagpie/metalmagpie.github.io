					<div style="background-image: url('images/hikershelping_small.jpg'); background-repeat: no-repeat;height: 220px; margin-left:10px;">
						<p style="padding:40px 30px 0px 300px">We can help professional managers understand the culture of professional services firms, and the mindset of those who work in them, with the benefit of considerable first-hand experience.</p>
				
						<h2 style="margin:20px 0px 0px 80px;">As your Coach, Mentor &amp; Career Manager, we offer you:</h2>
					</div>
					
					
					<ul>
						<li>A bespoke, confidential and action-orientated form of personal development.</li>
						<li>A trusted partner who is focussed on helping you achieve professional success and fulfilment.</li>
						<li>A safe but challenging process through which to acknowledge and address development issues.</li>
						<li>A 'time-out', to reflect, review progress and decide what to do differently.</li>
						<li>An opportunity to develop leadership and business generation skills in an 'off-line' environment.  </li>
						<li>One-to-one, objective feedback and an experienced sounding board.</li>
						<li>Real, tangible benefits for yourself and your organisation.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<a class="internal" name="careermanagement"><h2>Career Management</h2></a>
					<p>Today's managers must perform in a rapidly changing and increasingly challenging professional environment. This is leading some to reconsider their career choices. If you are one of them, we can help you to understand your career 'anchors', identify all of your options (not just the familiar ones) and advance down your chosen pathway.  Approached in this way, a career crisis can become the best thing that ever happened to you!</p>
				
					<h2>What makes us different?</h2>
